# Yoloo

Yoloo is a social portal which allows travelers ask questions such as accommodation, transportation, currency, food, budget, and places to visit. If you are travelling solo or in a group, even if you are just dreaming about travelling the whole world, Yoloo is a great place to start your adventure.  We help travelers to meet numerous locals, organize their trips with the help of the community, and share their experiences.  

This project is specifically designed for the use of travelers. The product will work as a social traveler network. 

> This project is also a senior project for Izmir University of Economics.
